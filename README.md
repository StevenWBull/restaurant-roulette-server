Restaurant Roulette is a application where a user can save their favorite restaurants in one easy to access place. Users are only able to see their own restaurants. The main feature of the application is the ability to to randomly pull out one restaurant from the entire saved list. This functionality allows the user to simplify their dining experience by not having to have the dreaded 'Where do you want to eat?' conversation with family, friends or significant others. For added effect, if the randomly generated restaurant doesn't fit the current craving of the user, a single button on the same page can be clicked to generate a new random restaurant.
